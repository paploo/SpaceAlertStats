Nothing serious, just a little something fun to do over a few Xmas break
afternoons:

SpaceAlert is a co-op board game that is played to the timing of a randomly
selected sountrack. I decided to look for the patterns in the mission
soundtracks in order to try to make a balanced semi-random mission generator.

It was also a great excuse to play with Scala again, as I had gotten rusty.
